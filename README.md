# Simple task manager for roadmap.sh
- This is a simple task manager developed in Java without dependencies (just maven to make the compilation faster).
- The project is so simple so there are no tests and code may contain some bug.
- This is just a Kata to learn how to deal with cli programs (installing in the system and that stuff).

### things to do
- [ ] Do a good handle of errors (the user must know what is doing bad)
- [ ] Move the database.json to .config folder
